    I Don't Have The Energy To Care Anymore
</div>

As you may/may not know, I use Jekyll to setup this blog--I even write a blog on how to setup Jekyll on Debian and Arch. But for some reason, I failed to resetup it on another device (WSL - Ubuntu). And I don't even have the energy to care anymore.  

For now, the solution is:
1. Clone this repo `git clone git@github.com:rahimi-mohd/rahimi-mohd.github.io.git`  
2. Go to `_posts`  
3. Add new file for new blog posts  
4. git push  

I really hope that this solution work, even if it just for now, because **I really don't have the energy to care anymore**. 

FYI, I've tried to resetup, following my own setup blog, read the docs, and even use ChatGPT for extra helping hand, but I failed.  

EDIT: It's worked!
