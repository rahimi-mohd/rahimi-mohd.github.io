<meta name="description" content="Hello, Jekyll! I actually really love to write and blog, the reason why I’m not updating my blog is because it’s pain in the ass to copy and paste my base.html–kinda like a template system for my blog. I actually heard about jekyll a long way back, but I don’t have time to try it (or maybe I’m lazy, I don’t know). So, what I’m looking for is a system or framework that can automate or render my writing into proper html, I try to use Emacs (org to html) and Obsidian (markdown to html) but I’ve never success with the templating system. Yes, I can export my writing into html but I struggle with the templating and styling. Now that I have some extra time to waste, I want to try jekyll and play around with it. First of all, we have to do some installation and setup before we can use jekyll. Setup I use Linux Mint for this setup, it will be different based on your operating system and distros. You actually can follow the step from jekyll’s Quickstart and Installation pages if you have any problems. Install all the requirements $ sudo apt install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev Add GEM_HOME and it executable path in .bashrc .bashrc GEM_HOME=&quot;$HOME/.gems&quot; # change .gems to gems if you don&#39;t want to hide it export PATH=$PATH:&quot;$HOME/.gems.bin&quot; Install jekyll and bundler $ gem install jekyll bundler Okay, now we’re halfway through the process. We’ve install Ruby, jekyll, and bundler. Now come the fun part, creating our blog. Create a new folder where you want to put your blog, let’s called it my-blog. $ mkdir -p Documents/my-blog # create folder $ cd Documents/my-blog # change direction into my-blog $ bundle init # create new Gemfile To add jekyll as dependency, we have to add gem &quot;jekyll&quot; into Gemfile, and run bundle to install it. It’s also a good time to start commiting our development journey, let’s initialize a Git repository and commit it. $ git init $ vim .gitignore # change vim to any editor you comfortable with .gitignore Gemfile.lock # this will prevent git to add Gemfile.lock into repository $ git add . # add all files and folders into stage $ git commit -m &quot;initial blog setup&quot; # commit all changes We’re almost there, the last step before we can serve our website is to have a….. website, Duh!. Remember that we still didn’t write any HTML, let’s fix that by creating new index.html in root folder and write anything you want–this is not HTML tutorial. To start serving your website, run $ jekyll serve and open http://localhost:4000 on your favorite web browser. Walla, here’s your magnificent, beautiful, little website ready to be seen by the entire world–Nah, just kidding, this only serve the website on your localhost port 4000, you have to deploy it to make it available to the entire world. Finally, remember that this is the most basic setup, you can follow the official step by step tutorial on jekyll website to get your website running and deploy it to github pages (like me) or maybe on your favorite cloud system or whatever, it’s your blog and you can do whatever you like with it. Reason It’s obvious why I changed to jekyll, but the main reason is the templating system. I already familiar with jinja2 and Django template (I don’t know what they called Django template, so maybe just Django template?), to have this kind of system is the major improvement for any blogger–one more time, I’m not a blogger blogger, just a guy who like to write and want to improve his workflow. My old, plain, and traditional blogging system look like this - index.html - blogs/ - base.html - blog1.html - blog2.html - statics - style.css - app.js I have to edit base.html, save it as blog{n}.hmlt, and index it in my index.html. Actually, it’s not so bad, but why not use templating system to make my life easier right ? Conclusion Actually, this is the second day I’m using jekyll–on the time I’m writing this post–so I can’t give more comment it pros and cons, and my experience using it, I will come back to it later. But for now, I’m excited to write more blog and to explore more about jekyll–theme? Finally, please, please, please excuse my website’s ugly interface, yeah I know it’s not beautiful (yet!), but I’m going to fix that later! …CYA!" />

    <h1>Move To Jekyll</h1>
<p>26 Aug 2024 - rahimi</p>
<hr>

<p><strong>Hello, Jekyll!</strong> I actually really love to write and blog, the reason why I’m not updating my blog is because it’s pain in the ass to copy and paste my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">base.html</code>–kinda like a template system for my blog. I actually heard about jekyll a long way back, but I don’t have time to try it (or maybe I’m lazy, I don’t know).</p>

<p>So, what I’m looking for is a system or framework that can automate or render my writing into proper html, I try to use Emacs (org to html) and Obsidian (markdown to html) but I’ve never success with the templating system. Yes, I can export my writing into html but I struggle with the templating and styling.</p>

<p>Now that I have some extra time to waste, I want to try jekyll and play around with it. First of all, we have to do some installation and setup before we can use jekyll.</p>

<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>

<p>I use Linux Mint for this setup, it will be different based on your operating system and distros. You actually can follow the step from jekyll’s <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/">Quickstart</a> and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/">Installation</a> pages if you have any problems.</p>

<p>Install all the requirements</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$ sudo apt install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev</code></p>

<p>Add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GEM_HOME</code> and it executable path in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bashrc</code></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
.bashrc
GEM_HOME="$HOME/.gems"  # change .gems to gems if you don't want to hide it
export PATH=$PATH:"$HOME/.gems.bin"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Install jekyll and bundler</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$ gem install jekyll bundler</code></p>

<p>Okay, now we’re halfway through the process. We’ve install Ruby, jekyll, and bundler. Now come the fun part, creating our blog. Create a new folder where you want to put your blog, let’s called it <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">my-blog</code>.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
$ mkdir -p Documents/my-blog    # create folder
$ cd Documents/my-blog          # change direction into my-blog
$ bundle init                   # create new Gemfile
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>To add jekyll as dependency, we have to add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem "jekyll"</code> into Gemfile, and run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle</code> to install it. It’s also a good time to start commiting our development journey, let’s initialize a Git repository and commit it.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
$ git init
$ vim .gitignore                        # change vim to any editor you comfortable with

.gitignore
Gemfile.lock                            # this will prevent git to add Gemfile.lock into repository

$ git add .                             # add all files and folders into stage 
$ git commit -m "initial blog setup"    # commit all changes
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’re almost there, the last step before we can serve our website is to have a….. website, Duh!. Remember that we still didn’t write any HTML, let’s fix that by creating new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.html</code> in root folder and write anything you want–this is not HTML tutorial. To start serving your website, run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$ jekyll serve</code> and open <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://localhost:4000</code> on your favorite web browser. Walla, here’s your magnificent, beautiful, little website ready to be seen by the entire world–Nah, just kidding, this only serve the website on your localhost port 4000, you have to deploy it to make it available to the entire world.</p>

<p>Finally, remember that this is the most basic setup, you can follow the official step by step tutorial on jekyll website to get your website running and deploy it to github pages (like me) or maybe on your favorite cloud system or whatever, it’s your blog and you can do whatever you like with it.</p>

<h3 id="reason">Reason</h3>

<p>It’s obvious why I changed to jekyll, but the main reason is the templating system. I already familiar with jinja2 and Django template (I don’t know what they called Django template, so maybe just Django template?), to have this kind of system is the major improvement for any blogger–one more time, I’m not a <strong>blogger</strong> blogger, just a guy who like to write and want to improve his workflow. My old, plain, and traditional blogging system look like this</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
- index.html  
- blogs/
    - base.html
    - blog1.html
    - blog2.html
- statics
    - style.css
    - app.js
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I have to edit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">base.html</code>, save it as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blog{n}.hmlt</code>, and index it in my index.html. Actually, it’s not so bad, but why not use templating system to make my life easier right ?</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Actually, this is the second day I’m using jekyll–on the time I’m writing this post–so I can’t give more comment it pros and cons, and my experience using it, I will come back to it later. But for now, I’m excited to write more blog and to explore more about jekyll–theme? Finally, please, please, please excuse my website’s ugly interface, yeah I know it’s not beautiful (yet!), but I’m going to fix that later!</p>
