    <p>Hello, I’m Rahimi. This page will gives some background and information about me.</p>

<h3 id="study">Study</h3>

<p>05-2022 - Now, Open University Malaysia<br />
Diploma in Information Technology (Final Year)<br />
CGPA: 3.85</p>

<h4 id="clinic-management-system-wip">Clinic Management System [WIP]</h4>

<p>09-2024 - Now, Work In Progress<br />
This is my diploma final year project. In this project, I use Django for backend, HTML with Bootstrap5 for frontend, and a <strong>very</strong> little of CSS. I use Django because I already familiar with Python, so why not right ?</p>

<p>Next, I have a plan to write functional testing using Playwright. I read a little of Obey The Testing Goat <a href="https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/pages/book.html">book</a>, I will try to implement the test, but using Playwright instead of Selenium.</p>

<p>I’ve always wonder how management system work from the inside (backend), how you design the models with their relationship etc, that’s why I chose to do CMS for my FYP. This project, even it’s quite small and not business ready (<strong>and still WIP</strong>), have teach me a lot of thing.</p>

<p>Lastly, there’s debate regarding function based view (FBV) or class based view (CBV) in writing Django program. I actually have other repo (private) which I write the same program using CBV, but I stop refactoring and updating it after sometime due to several reason, mainly because I feel like I don’t have full control over my code.</p>

<p>Hence the FBV in this repo which you can find in the link below.</p>

<h4 id="todo-list">Todo List</h4>

<p>21-09-2024 - 22-09-2024<br />
Yet another Todo App, right ? This is the first app that I write while learning Django. I guess almost all people who tried to learn programming will write Todo app, be it command line, GUI, or web app.</p>

<p>I actually have the command line version which I wrote back then, so this time, why not write a web app version since I’m learning Django.</p>

<p>There also a functional test which written in Playwright, I tried to cover as much that I can with the test.</p>

<p>If you’re interest in yet another Todo app, you can check it here:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Command Line version - 03-11-2022<br />

  <li>Web App version<br />

<h4 id="programmer-at-aces-ecer-jobs-train-and-place">Programmer at Aces-Ecer Jobs Train and Place</h4>

<p>09-2021 - 06-2022<br />
This is a six month learning and training on the job program. They teach me about HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, PHP, and Wordpress during the first month. Then, participant have to be in group of four to design mockup website using Wordpress. Among the website that my team design and build are e-commerce, government, and personal website.</p>

<p>I already know a little bit or programming–due to self learn–and linux, they teach participant to setup and use Laragon on Windows, but I have to teach myself how to setup and use XAMPP because I’m on Linux. Other things that I learn here is to do sofware testing, I tried to develop website using Test Driven Development (TDD) approach, I started by writing test, and add feature based on the test, finally refactor both the test and feature.</p>

<h4 id="operation-assistant--customer-service">Operation Assistant &amp; Customer Service</h4>

<p>02-2017 - 02-2021<br />
This is the place that have teach me alot of stuff, be it about work or life. I learn how to talk to people, give technical support, manage reports, use CRM such as Salesforce and develop friendship with many people (office mate and customers).</p>

<p>My main task here is to provide service and support to customers, which includes in processing order, give technical support (regarding company apps, how to use it, features, etc), and data entry (manage sales and stock report). I also use Salesforce to open ticket, communicate with other department and handle customer enquiry.</p>

<p>Even this is not IT job, I still manage to learn a lot of IT stuff. I learn how to troubleshoot company app, Use Salesforce, etc.</p>

<h4 id="legal-clerk">Legal Clerk</h4>

<p>2016 - 02-2017<br />
My first ever job, I actually learn quite a lot here. The first task that I do here is to manage file room. This include in re-arrange all the file based on year, racks and re-record it in system. Maybe this is why I want to create a clinic management system for my diploma final year project. God know how hard it is to re-arrange thousand of files and re-record it.</p>

<h3 id="interest">Interest</h3>

<p>Beside my diploma final year project, I have to take other three courses which is:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Basics Of Linux,</li>
  <li>Java Programming, and</li>
  <li>Introduction To Software Engineering</li>
</ol>

<p>So, I try to focus mainly on my courses and learning Django.</p>

<p>In the future, I want to learn Rust–have always been in my interest list–for the fun on it. I’ve actually start to read <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/">The Book</a> until chapter 6 (if I remember correctly), but have to pause for awhile due to college and life.</p>
