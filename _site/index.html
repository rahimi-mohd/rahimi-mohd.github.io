        Hello, Jekyll! I actually really love to write and blog, the reason why I’m not updating my blog is because it’s pain in the ass to copy and paste my base.html–kinda like a template system for my blog. I actually heard about jekyll a long way back, but I don’t...

        I use Arch BTW! I have been a avid linux user since the late of 2019 due to my obsession with Mr. Robot and hacker wannabe cringey teenager. Long story short, I failed on my attemp to be a hacker obviously, and after distros later, I stick with Linux Mint....
